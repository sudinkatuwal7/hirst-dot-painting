# 🎨 Hirst Dot Spectrum

A generative art project in Python inspired by Damien Hirst’s iconic spot paintings.  
This project creates colorful dot patterns using the `turtle` module and a custom color palette, producing a unique artwork every time you run it. 🌈

## 🌟 Features

- 🎨 Generates Hirst-style colorful dot patterns  
- 🟢 Randomized colors for unique results each time  
- 🐍 Built with Python's `turtle` module  
- ⚙️ Fully customizable: dot size, spacing, number of dots, and color palette  
- ✨ Every run creates a **distinct generative artwork**

## 🚀 Installation & How to Run 

- Clone the repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/sudinkatuwal7/hirst-dot-painting.git
```

Then move into the project folder:
```
cd hirst-dot-painting
```
- ```Optional``` Install colorgram.py

If you want to extract colors from an image in the future (like project.jpg), install:
```
pip install colorgram.py
```

Installing this package is optional since your project already has a hard‑coded color list. It’s only needed if you update the code to extract a palette automatically.

- Run the program

```
python main.py
```

## ⚙️ Customization

Adjust the following variables in the script to tweak your artwork:

- num_dots → total number of dots

- dot_size → size of each dot

- spacing → space between dots

- row_length → number of dots per row

color_list → list of RGB colors to use 🎨
